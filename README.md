# Dungine
### RPG Dungeon Crawler API/Language

### Overview
The Dungine language (hereafter just "Dungine") is a tool for quickly and easily creating games using the Dungine API.
There are two types of Dungine files, each with different syntax: headers (.dgnh) and game files (.dgn).
Header files follow a simple __command__ *args* syntax, which game files are more similar to JSON.
The entry point for any Dungine game is __main.dgnh__.
All files must be in a folder called __LocalFiles__ that is in the same directory as the .jar file.

### Header Commands
 + __read__ "*path*"
